# Bikesharing

## Overview of the analysis

In this module, we'll work with Tableau's data visualization software to present a bike-sharing company's business proposal. First, we'll learn how to accurately import, style, and accurately portray data. Then, we'll create worksheets, dashboards, and stories to visualize key data from a New York Citi Bike dataset.

What we learned and applied in this project:

- Import data into Tableau.
- Create and style worksheets, dashboards, and stories in Tableau.
- Use Tableau worksheets to display data professionally.
- Portray data accurately using Tableau dashboards.

## Results

We gather our data in 5 different Tableau dashboards where we can go deep into details.

## Summary

Based on the data set we analyze we feel confident to share with the investors the following facts:
- 65.2% of Citi bikes' customers are men who ride over 1M 500K trips in a month. 
- Based on the customer's age our market should be focused on men and women over 28 years. 
- According to the trip's start and end locations the most used stations are the ones closer to the building's offices and public transportation.
- 75% of the trips have a duration of fewer than 19 minutes.
- 81% of the users have an annual subscription.
- Our busiest hours will be between 7am - 9am and between 5pm - 7pm
### Additional vizualizations for future analysis
- To forecast monthly incomes, we suggest gathering data regarding custom fees and subscription plans. 
- Add a table displaying the top 50 stations to guarantee availability during rush hours.
